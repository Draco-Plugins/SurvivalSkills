# Java Development

## General Instructions

-   Implement the Best practices, bug patterns and code smell prevention guidelines outlined below.
-   Address code smells proactively during development rather than accumulating technical debt.
-   Focus on readability, maintainability, and performance when refactoring identified issues.
-   Use IDE / Code editor reported warnings and suggestions to catch common patterns early in development.

## Best practices

-   **Records**: For classes primarily intended to store data (e.g., DTOs, immutable data structures), **Java Records should be used instead of traditional classes**.
-   **Pattern Matching**: Utilize pattern matching for `instanceof` and `switch` expression to simplify conditional logic and type casting.
-   **Type Inference**: Use `var` for local variable declarations to improve readability, but only when the type is explicitly clear from the right-hand side of the expression.
-   **Immutability**: Favor immutable objects. Make classes and fields `final` where possible. Use collections from `List.of()`/`Map.of()` for fixed data. Use `Stream.toList()` to create immutable lists.
-   **Streams and Lambdas**: Use the Streams API and lambda expressions for collection processing. Employ method references (e.g., `stream.map(Foo::toBar)`).
-   **Null Handling**: Avoid returning or accepting `null`. Use `Optional<T>` for possibly-absent values and `Objects` utility methods like `equals()` and `requireNonNull()`.

### Naming Conventions

-   Follow Google's Java style guide:
    -   `UpperCamelCase` for class and interface names.
    -   `lowerCamelCase` for method and variable names.
    -   `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants.
    -   `lowercase` for package names.
-   Use nouns for classes (`UserService`) and verbs for methods (`getUserById`).
-   Avoid abbreviations and Hungarian notation.

### Logging

-   Log frequently but avoid excessive logging.
-   For all Minecraft plugin development use the format `Bukkit.getLogger().log(Level.<LEVEL>, "[PluginName] <message>", <exception>)`.
-   Use appropriate log levels (`INFO`, `WARNING`, `SEVERE`, etc.) and avoid logging sensitive information.
-   If messages contain variables use String.format() for better readability and performance.

### Bug Patterns

| Rule ID | Description                                                 | Example / Notes                                                        |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `S2095` | Resources should be closed                                  | Use try-with-resources when working with streams, files, sockets, etc. |
| `S1698` | Objects should be compared with `.equals()` instead of `==` | Especially important for Strings and boxed primitives.                 |
| `S1905` | Redundant casts should be removed                           | Clean up unnecessary or unsafe casts.                                  |
| `S3518` | Conditions should not always evaluate to true or false      | Watch for infinite loops or if-conditions that never change.           |
| `S108`  | Unreachable code should be removed                          | Code after `return`, `throw`, etc., must be cleaned up.                |

## Code Smells

| Rule ID | Description                                     | Example / Notes                                                |
| ------- | ----------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `S107`  | Methods should not have too many parameters     | Refactor into helper classes or use builder pattern.           |
| `S121`  | Duplicated blocks of code should be removed     | Consolidate logic into shared methods.                         |
| `S138`  | Methods should not be too long                  | Break complex logic into smaller, testable units.              |
| `S3776` | Cognitive complexity should be reduced          | Simplify nested logic, extract methods, avoid deep `if` trees. |
| `S1192` | String literals should not be duplicated        | Replace with constants or enums.                               |
| `S1854` | Unused assignments should be removed            | Avoid dead variables—remove or refactor.                       |
| `S109`  | Magic numbers should be replaced with constants | Improves readability and maintainability.                      |
| `S1188` | Catch blocks should not be empty                | Always log or handle exceptions meaningfully.                  |
