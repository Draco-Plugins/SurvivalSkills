# SurvivalSkills
A Minecraft plugin meant to enhance the survival experience and give players more things to do while also guiding them through the vanilla Minecraft experience.
This plugin was created to improve the 2-week Minecraft kick that players get today and potentially keep them playing for longer periods of time.
